# Flask Backend Project (ZOMATO SEARCH)

## Description

This Flask backend project serves as the server-side component of a web application. It handles data processing, serves APIs, and interfaces with a database. Key features include loading data into an SQLite database, handling various routes, and integrating machine learning models for image classification.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd flask_backend_project
    ```

3. Set up a virtual environment (recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. Set up the database and migrations (if applicable):
    ```bash
    flask db upgrade
    ```

## Usage

To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
python run.py
```

This will start the Flask application and also load data into the SQLite database from the provided CSV file.

You can also use Flask's built-in server for development purposes:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=run.py
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```

## Routes

The `routes.py` file defines various routes for the application, handling requests related to restaurants, image searches, and more. Key functions include:

- `show_all_restaurants()`: Displays all restaurants with pagination.
- `home()`: Displays the home page.
- `search_restaurant()`: Searches for restaurants based on various criteria.
- `restaurant_details()`: Displays details of a specific restaurant.
- `image_search()`: Handles image classification and restaurant search based on images.

## Models

The `models.py` file defines the `Restaurant` model used for interacting with the SQLite database. Key attributes include:

- `id`: Primary key.
- `name`: Name of the restaurant.
- `cuisines`: Types of cuisines offered.
- `average_cost_for_two`: Average cost for two people.
- `aggregate_rating`: Aggregate rating of the restaurant.
- `has_online_delivery`: Indicates if online delivery is available.

The `Restaurant` class also includes methods for serializing instances to dictionaries.

## Data Loading

The `load_data_to_db.py` file contains a function `load_data_to_sqlite()` that loads data from a CSV file into the SQLite database. Key steps include:

1. Loading data into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Dropping existing tables and creating new ones.
3. Adding data to the database and committing the changes.

## Application Setup

The `app.py` file is responsible for creating and configuring the Flask application. Key functions include:

- `create_app()`: Initializes the Flask application, sets up database configurations, and registers routes.
- Configures CORS for cross-origin resource sharing.
- Sets up SQLAlchemy for database interactions.
- Configures Flask-Migrate for database migrations.
- Specifies the upload folder for images.
